<p>This is a list of children's books I wrote up for the readers of <a
href="http://www.hblist.com">HBL</a> (and anyone else who wants it). I regret not having the time to
edit it up to publication quality, but it should be useful.</p>

<hr>

<p>First and foremost, I recommend just about anything by Lloyd
Alexander. He is my favorite children's author. I particularly recommend
The Prydain Chronicles, a five-book fantasy adventure series. The
individual books are called <i>The Book of Three</i>, <i>The Black
Cauldron</i>, <i>The Castle of Llyr</i>, <i>Taran Wanderer</i> and <i>The
High King</i>. The stories are very powerful; Lloyd Alexander has a
wonderful sense of drama. <i>The High King</i> is my favorite children's
book of all time (although to appreciate it, of course, you have to read
the whole series). Alexander also wrote The Vesper Holly Adventures,
another five-book series I recommend, and a number of other books.</p>

<p>The second author who comes to mind is Roald Dahl. In particular,
I remember liking <i>Matilda</i> and <i>The Witches</i>. Also good were
<i>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</i>, <i>Charlie and the Great Glass
Elevator</i>, and <i>The BFG</i> (that's Big Friendly Giant). Dahl can
be a little gruesome at times, but in creative ways&mdash;pre-teens should
be able to handle him with no problem. Dahl's stories are whimsical and
strange, but fun adventures.</p>

<p>Some series which are good:</p>

<p>The Alvin Fernald series, by Clifford B. Hicks. Alvin Fernald is
a young teen who is an inventor&mdash;the first book I read was called
<i>The Marvelous Inventions of Alvin Fernald</i>, which featured about an
invention per chapter. I remember loving this series, because I wanted
to be an inventor when I was young. (Alvin's inventions don't play a
role in every book, but his intelligence does).</p>

<p>The Danny Dunn series, a kid's sci-fi series by Jay Williams. It was
written in the '50s, I think, so you get books like <i>Danny Dunn and
the Homework Machine</i>, about a computer, and <i>Danny Dunn and the
Anti-Gravity Paint</i>, about a spaceship. Again, this series highlights
the intelligence of Danny and his friends.</p>

<p>The Great Brain series, by John D. Fitzgerald, with about 10 books, the
first of which is titled simply <i>The Great Brain</i>. The Great Brain
was a young boy who lived in a small town in Utah in the early 1900s. The
series is all about his adventures, mostly through entrepreneurial
adventures, as I recall.</p>

<p>The Tripods trilogy, by John Christopher. The first book is called
<i>The White Mountains</i>. (There was also a prequel to the trilogy,
but I started reading it and never finished.) It's fantasy/sci-fi. The
main value to this series is simply its drama.</p>

<p>Some individual books I recommend:</p>

<p><i>The Girl Who Owned a City</i>, by O. T. Nelson, about a future world
in which all people over the age of 12 are killed off by a mysterious
disease, and the children are left to fend for themselves. The heroine
in this one is a very strong and resourceful character; I like her
very much.</p>

<p><i>The Phantom Tollbooth</i>, by Norton Juster, a whimsical adventure
which also champions learning and intelligence (the hero is on a quest
to save Rhyme and Reason&mdash;twin princesses who are locked in the Castle
in the Air).</p>

<p><i>The Hobbit</i>, by J. R. R. Tolkien, the prequel to the famous
Lord of the Rings trilogy. This is another good fantasy adventure. (I
started the trilogy, BTW, and found it boring&mdash;the reverse of the
White Mountains).</p>

<p><i>The Hatchet</i>, by Gary Paulsen, about a kid who is suddenly left
to fend for himself in the forest, miles from civilization. There is one
gruesome scene near the end of the book, but I read it when I was about 12
and survived. The hero has great persistence and earns his survival under
seemingly impossible circumstances. Gary Paulsen has written a number
of other books with similar plots, but be warned that they may not all
be good&mdash;my mother told me about one book of his, <i>The Rifle</i>,
I believe, that involved an innoncent young boy being accidentally shot
in the head. <i>The Hatchet</i>, however, has no such faults.</p>

<p>Another thing that might be worth trying is kid's versions of the
classics, or perhaps just the classics themselves. I remember reading
kid's versions of Jules Verne (<i>Journey to the Center of the Earth</i>,
in particular) and Sherlock Holmes stories.</p>
