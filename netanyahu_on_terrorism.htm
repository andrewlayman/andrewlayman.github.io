<h1>Statement of former Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu</h1>
<h2>before the  Government Reform Committee  September 20, 2001</h2> 
<p>
 I want to thank you for inviting me to appear before you today. I 

feel a profound responsibility addressing you in this hour of peril in 

the capital of liberty. 
</p><p>
 

 What is at stake today is nothing less than the survival of our 

civilization. There may be some who would have thought a week ago that 

to talk in these apocalyptic terms about the battle against international 

terrorism was to engage in reckless exaggeration. No longer. 

 </p><p>

 Each one of us today understands that we are all targets, that our 

cities are vulnerable, and that our values are hated with an unmatched 

fanaticism that seeks to destroy our societies and our way of life. 

 I am certain that I speak on behalf of my entire nation when I say - 

Today, we are all Americans - in grief, as in defiance. 

 </p><p>

 In grief, because my people have faced the agonizing horrors of 

terror for many decades, and we feel an instant kinship with both the 

victims of this tragedy and the great nation that mourns its fallen 

brothers and sisters. 

 </p><p>

 In defiance, because just as my country continues to fight terrorism 

in our battle for survival, I know that America will not cower before 

this challenge. 

 </p><p>

 I have absolute confidence that if we, the citizens of the free 

world, led by President Bush, marshall the enormous reserves of power at 

our disposal, harness the steely resolve of a free people, and mobilize our 

collective will -- we shall eradicate this evil from the face of the 

earth. 
</p><p>
 

 But to achieve this goal, we must first however answer several 

questions: Who is responsible for this terrorist onslaught? Why? What is 

the motive behind these attacks? And most importantly, what must be done to 

defeat these evil forces? 

 </p><p>

 The first and most crucial thing to understand is this: There is no 

international terrorism without the support of sovereign states. 

International terrorism simply cannot be sustained for long without the 

regimes that aid and abet it. 

 </p><p>

 Terrorists are not suspended in mid-air. They train, arm and 

indoctrinate their killers from within safe havens on territory provided 

by terrorist states. Often these regimes provide the terrorists with 

intelligence, money and operational assistance, dispatching them to 

serve as deadly proxies to wage a hidden war against more powerful enemies. 

 </p><p>

 These regimes mount a worldwide propaganda campaign to legitimize 

terror, besmirching its victims and exculpating its practitioners -- as 

we witnessed in the farcical spectacle in Durban last month. 

 Iran, Libya, and Syria call the US and Israel racist countries that 

abuse human rights? 

 </p><p>

 Even Orwell could not have imagined such a world. 

 </p><p>

 Take away all this state support, and the entire scaffolding of 

international terrorism will collapse into the dust. 

 </p><p>

 The international terrorist network is thus based on regimes - Iran, 

Iraq, Syria, Taleban Afghanistan, Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority 

and several other Arab regimes such as the Sudan. 

 These regimes are the ones that harbor the terrorist groups: Osama 

Bin Laden in Afghanistan, Hizballah and others in Syrian-controlled 

Lebanon, Hamas, Islamic Jihad and the recently mobilized Fatah and Tanzim 

factions in the Palestinian territories, and sundry other terror organizations based 

in such capitals as Damascus, Baghdad and Khartoum. 

 </p><p>

 These terrorist states and terror organizations together form a 

terror network, whose constituent parts support each other operationally 

as well as politically. 

 </p><p>

 For example, the Palestinian groups cooperate closely with 

Hezbollah, which in turn links them to Syria, Iran and Bin Laden. 

 </p><p>

 These offshoots of terror have affiliates in other states that have 

not yet uprooted their presence, such as Egypt, Yemen and Saudi Arabia. 

 </p><p>

 Now, how did this come about? The growth of this terror network is 

the result of several developments in the last two decades: Chief among 

them is the Khomeini Revolution and the establishment of a clerical Islamic 

state in Iran. 

 </p><p>

 This created a sovereign spiritual base for fomenting a strident 

Islamic militancy worldwide -- a militancy that was often backed by 

terror. 

 </p><p>

 Equally important was the victory in the Afghan war of the 

international mujaheedin brotherhood. 

 </p><p>

 This international band of zealots, whose ranks include Osama Bin 

Laden, saw their victory over the Soviet Union as providential proof of 

the innate supremacy of faithful Moslems over the weak infidel powers. 

 </p><p>

 They believed that even the superior weapons of a superpower could 

not withstand their superior will. 

 </p><p>

 To this should also be added Saddam Hussein's escape from 

destruction at the end of the Gulf War, his dismissal of UN monitors, 

and his growing confidence that he can soon develop unconventional weapons 

to match those of the West. 

 </p><p>

 Finally, the creation of Yasser Arafat's terror enclave gave a safe 

haven to militant Islamic terrorist groups such as Hamas and Islamic 

Jihad. 

 </p><p>

 Like their mujaheedin cousins, they drew inspiration from Israel's 

hasty withdrawal from Lebanon, glorified as a great Moslem victory by 

the Syrian-backed Hizballah. 

 </p><p>

 Under Arafat's rule, these Palestinian Islamic terrorist groups made 

repeated use of the technique of suicide bombing, going so far as to run 

summer camps in Gaza that teach Palestinian children how to become 

suicide martyrs. 
</p><p>
 

 Here is what Arafat's government controlled newspaper, Al Hayat Al 

Jadida, said on September 11, the very day of the suicide bombing of the 

World Trade Center and the Pentagon: 

 </p><p>

 "The suicide bombers of today are the noble successors of the 

Lebanese suicide bombers, who taught the US Marines a tough lesson in 

[Lebanon]... These suicide bombers are the salt of the earth, the 

engines of history... They are the most honorable people among us... ". 

 </p><p>

 A simple rule prevails here: The success of terrorists in one part 

of the terror network emboldens terrorists throughout the network. 

 
</p><p>
 This then is the Who. Now for the Why. 

 </p><p>

 Though its separate parts may have local objectives and take part in 

local conflicts, the main motivation driving the terror network is an 

anti-Western hostility that seeks to achieve nothing less than a 

reversal of history. 

 </p><p>

 It seeks to roll back the West and install an extremist form of 

Islam as the dominant power in the world. 

 </p><p>

 It seeks to do this not by means of its own advancement and 

progress, but by destroying the enemy. This hatred is the product of a 

seething resentment that has simmered for centuries in certain parts of 

the Arab and Islamic world. 

 
</p><p>
 Most Moslems in the world, including the vast majority of the 

growing Moslem communities in the West, are not guided by this 

interpretation of history, nor are they moved by its call for a holy war 

against the West. 

 
</p><p>
 But some are. And though their numbers are small compared to the 

peaceable majority, they nevertheless constitute a growing hinterland 

for this militancy. 

 
</p><p>
 Militant Islamists resented the West for pushing back the triumphant 

march of Islam into the heart of Europe many centuries ago. 

 </p><p>

 Its adherents, believing in the innate supremacy of Islam, then 

suffered a series of shocks when in the last two centuries that same 

hated, supposedly inferior West penetrated Islamic realms in North Africa, the 

Middle East and the Persian Gulf. 

 </p><p>

 For them the mission was clear: The West had to be first pushed out 

of these areas. Pro-western Middle Eastern regimes were toppled in rapid 

succession, including in Iran. 
</p><p>
 

 And Israel, the Middle East's only democracy and its purest 

manifestation of Western progress and freedom, must be wiped off the 

face of the earth. 

 </p><p>

 Thus, the soldiers of militant Islam do not hate the West because of 

Israel, they hate Israel because of the West -- because they see it is 

an island of Western democratic values in a Moslem-Arab sea of despotism. 
</p><p>
 

 That is why they call Israel the Little Satan, to distinguish it 

clearly from the country that has always been and will always be the 

Great Satan - The United States of America. 

 </p><p>

 Nothing better illustrates this then Osama bin Laden's call for 

Jihad against the United States in 1998. He gave as his primary reason 

not Israel, not the Palestinians, not the 'peace process', but rather the 

very presence of the United States 'occupying the Land of Islam in the 

holiest of places' -- and where is that? -- 'the Arabian peninsula' says Bin Laden, 

where America is 'plundering its riches, dictating to its rulers, and 

humiliating its people.' Israel, by the way, comes a distant third, after 'the 

continuing aggression against the Iraqi people.' [Al Quds al Arabi - 

February 23, 1998] 

 
</p><p>
 For the Bin Ladens of the world Israel is merely a sideshow. America 

is the target. 
</p><p>
 

 But reestablishing a resurgent Islam requires not just rolling back 

the West; it requires destroying its main engine, the United States. And 

if the US cannot be destroyed just now, it can be first humiliated -- as in 

the Teheran hostage crisis two decades ago -- and then ferociously attacked 

again and again, until it is brought to its knees. 

 </p><p>

 But the ultimate goal remains the same: Destroy America and win 

eternity. 
</p><p>

 Some of you may find it hard to believe that Islamic militants truly 

cling to the mad fantasy of destroying America. Make no mistake about 

it. They do. And unless they are stopped now, their attacks will continue, 

and become even more lethal in the future. 
</p><p>

 To understand the true dangers of Islamic militancy, we can compare 

it to another ideology which sought world domination -- communism. Both 

movements pursued irrational goals, but the communists at least pursued 

theirs in a rational way. 
</p><p>
 

 Anytime they had to choose between ideology and their own survival, 

as in Cuba or Berlin, they backed off and chose survival. 

 </p><p>

 Not so for the Islamic militants. They pursue an irrational ideology 

irrationally -- with no apparent regard for human life, neither their 

own lives nor the lives of their enemies. The Communists seldom, if ever, 

produced suicide bombers, while Islamic militancy produces hordes of 

them, glorifying them and promising them that their dastardly deeds will earn 

them a glorious afterlife. 

 </p><p>

 This highly pathological aspect of Islamic militancy is what makes 

it so deadly for mankind. 

 </p><p>

 When in 1996, I wrote a book about fighting terrorism, I warned 

about the militant Islamic groups operating in the West with the support 

of foreign powers -- serving as a new breed of "domestic-international" 

terrorists, basing themselves in America to wage Jihad against America: 

 </p><p>

 Such groups, I wrote then, nullify in large measure the need to have 

air power or intercontinental missiles as delivery systems for an 

Islamic nuclear payload. They will be the delivery system. In the worst of such 

scenarios, I wrote, the consequences could be not a car bomb but a 

nuclear bomb in the basement of the World Trade Center. 
</p><p>
 

 Well, they did not use a nuclear bomb. They used two 150 ton fully 

fueled jetliners to wipe out the Twin Towers. But does anyone doubt that 

given the chance, they will throw atom bombs at America and its allies? 

And perhaps long before that, chemical and biological weapons? 

 </p><p>

 This is the greatest danger facing our common future. Some states of 

the terror network already possess chemical and biological capabilities, 

and some are feverishly developing nuclear weapons. Can one rule out the 

possibility that they will be tempted to use such weapons, openly or 

through terror proxies, or that their weapons might fall into the hands of the 

terrorist groups they harbor? 

 </p><p>

 We have received a wake up call from hell. Now the question is 

simple: Do we rally to defeat this evil, while there is still time, or 

do we press a collective snooze button and go back to business as usual? 

 </p><p>

 The time for action is now. 

 </p><p>

 Today the terrorists have the will to destroy us, but they do not 

have the power. There is no doubt that we have the power to crush them. 

Now we must also show that we have the will to do just that. 

 
</p><p>
 Once any part of the terror network acquires nuclear weapons, this 

equation will fundamentally change, and with it the course of human 

affairs. 

 </p><p>

 This is the historical imperative that now confronts all of us. 

 </p><p>

 And now the third point: What do we about it? 

 </p><p>

 First, as President Bush said, we must make no distinction between 

the terrorists and the states that support them. It is not enough to 

root out the terrorists who committed this horrific act of war. We must 

dismantle the entire terrorist network. 

 </p><p>

 If any part of it remains intact, it will rebuild itself, and the 

specter of terrorism will reemerge and strike again. 

 </p><p>

 Bin Laden, for example, has shuttled over the last decade from Saudi 

Arabia to Afghanistan to the Sudan and back again. So we must not leave 

any base intact. 

 </p><p>

 To achieve this goal we must first have moral clarity. We must fight 

terror wherever and whenever it appears. We must make all states play by 

the same rules. We must declare terrorism a crime against humanity, and we 

must consider the terrorists enemies of mankind, to be given no quarter and 

no consideration for their purported grievances. 

 </p><p>

 If we begin to distinguish between acts of terror, justifying some 

and repudiating others based on sympathy with this or that cause, we 

will lose the moral clarity that is so essential for victory. 

 </p><p>

 This clarity is what enabled America and Britain to root out piracy 

in the nineteenth century. This is how the Allies rooted out Nazism in 

the twentieth century. 
</p><p>
 

 They did not look for the "root cause" of piracy or the "root cause" 

of Nazism - because they knew that some acts are evil in and of 

themselves, and do not deserve any consideration or "understanding." 

 </p><p>

 They did not ask if Hitler was right about the alleged wrong done to 

Germany at Versailles. That they left to the historians. The leaders of 

the Western Alliance said something else: Nothing justifies Nazism. Nothing! 
</p><p>
 

 We must be equally clear cut today: Nothing justifies terrorism, 

Nothing! 
</p><p>
 

 Terrorism is defined not by the identity of its perpetrators nor by 

the cause they espouse. Rather, it is defined by the nature of the act. 

 </p><p>

 Terrorism is the deliberate attack on innocent civilians. In this it 

must be distinguished from legitimate acts of war that target combatants 

and may unintentionally harm civilians. 

 </p><p>

 When the British bombed a Gestapo headquarters in 1944, and one of 

their bombs unintentionally struck a children's hospital that was a 

tragedy, but it was not terrorism. 

 </p><p>

 When Israel fired a missile that killed two Hamas arch-terrorists, 

and two Palestinians children who were playing nearby were tragically 

struck down, that is not terrorism. 

 </p><p>

 But terrorists do not unintentionally harm civilians. They 

deliberately murder, maim, and menace civilians -- as many as possible. 

 </p><p>

 No cause, no grievance, no apology can ever justify terrorism. 

Terrorism against Americans, Israelis, Spaniards, Britons, Russians, or 

anyone else, is all part of the same evil and must be treated as such. 

 </p><p>

 It is time to establish a fixed principle for the international 

community: any cause that uses terrorism to advance its aims will not be 

rewarded. On the contrary, it will be punished and placed beyond the 

pale. 

 </p><p>

 Armed with this moral clarity in defining terrorism, we must possess 

an equal moral clarity in fighting it. 

 </p><p>

 If we include Iran, Syria, and the Palestinian Authority in the 

coalition to fight terror -- even though they currently harbor, sponsor 

and dispatch terrorists -- then the alliance against terror will be defeated 

from within. 

 </p><p>

 Perhaps we might achieve a short-term objective of destroying one 

terrorist fiefdom, but it will preclude the possibility of overall 

victory. 

 </p><p>

Such a coalition will melt down because of its own internal 

contradictions. 
</p><p>
 

 We might win a battle. We will certainly lose the war. 

 </p><p>

 These regimes, like all terrorist states, must be given a forthright 

demand: Stop terrorism, permanently, or you will face the wrath of the 

free world -- through harsh and sustained political, economic and military 

sanctions. 

 
</p><p>
 Obviously, some of these regimes will scramble in fear and issue 

platitudes about their opposition to terror, just as Arafat, Iran and 

Syria did, while they keep their terror apparatus intact. We should not be 

fooled. 
</p><p>
 

These regimes are already on the US lists of states supporting terrorism 

-- and if they're not, they should be. 

 
</p><p>
 The price of admission for any state into the coalition against 

terror must be to first completely dismantle the terrorist 

infrastructures within their realm. 

 </p><p>

 Iran will have to dismantle a worldwide network of terrorism and 

incitement based in Teheran. 

 </p><p>

 Syria will have to shut down Hizballah and the dozen terrorist 

organizations that operate freely in Damascus and in Lebanon. 

 </p><p>

 Arafat will have to crush Hamas and Islamic Jihad, close down their 

suicide factories and training grounds, rein in his own Fatah and Tanzim 

terrorists and cease the endless incitement to violence. 

 </p><p>

 To win this war, we must fight on many fronts. The most obvious one 

is direct military action against the terrorists themselves. Israel's 

policy of preemptively striking at those who seek to murder its people is, I 

believe, better understood today and requires no further elaboration. 

 </p><p>

 But there is no substitute for the key action that we must take: 

Imposing the most punishing diplomatic, economic and military sanction 

on all terrorist states; 

 
</p><p>
 To this must be added these measures: 

 
</p><p>
 Freeze financial assets in the West of terrorist regimes and 

organizations; 

 Revise legislation, subject to periodic renewal, to enable better 

surveillance against organizations inciting violence; 

 Keep convicted terrorist behind bars. Do not negotiate with 

terrorists; 

 Train special forces to fight terror. 

 </p><p>

 And Not least important, impose sanctions on suppliers of nuclear 

technology to terrorist states. 

 </p><p>

 I've had some experience in pursuing all these courses of action in 

Israel's battle against terrorism, and I will be glad to elaborate on 

any one of them if you wish, including the sensitive questions surrounding 

intelligence. 

 </p><p>

 But I have to be clear: Victory over terrorism is not, at its most 

fundamental level, a matter of law enforcement or intelligence. However 

important these functions may be, they can only reduce the dangers, not 

eliminate them. 

 
</p><p>
 The immediate objective is to end all state support for, and 

complicity with, terror. If vigorously and continuously challenged, most 

of these regimes can be deterred from sponsoring terrorism. 

 
</p><p>
 But there is a real possibility that some will not be deterred-and 

those may be ones that possess weapons of mass destruction. 

 </p><p>

 Again, we cannot dismiss the possibility that a militant terrorist 

state will use its proxies to threaten or launch a nuclear attack with 

apparent impunity. 

 </p><p>

 Nor can we completely dismiss the possibility that a militant 

regime, like its terrorist proxies, will commit collective suicide for 

the sake of its fanatical ideology. 

 
</p><p>
 In this case, we might face not thousands of dead, but hundreds of 

thousands and possibly millions. This is why the US must do everything 

in its power to prevent regimes like Iran and Iraq from developing nuclear 

weapons, and disarm them of their weapons of mass destruction. 

 </p><p>

 This is the great mission that now stands before the free world. 

That mission must not be watered down to allow certain states to 

participate in the coalition that is now being organized. Rather, the coalition must 

be built around this mission. 

 </p><p>

 It may be that some will shy away from adopting such an 

uncompromising stance against terrorism. If some free states choose to 

remain on the sidelines, America must be prepared to march forward 

without them -- for there is no substitute for moral and strategic clarity. 

 
</p><p>
 I believe that if the United States stands on principle, all the 

democracies will eventually join the war on terrorism. The easy route 

may be tempting, but it will not win the day. 
</p><p>

 On September eleventh, I, like everyone else, was glued to a 

television set watching the savagery that struck America. Yet amid the 

smoking ruins of the Twin Towers one could make out the Statue of 

Liberty holding high the torch of freedom. 
</p><p>
 

 It is freedom's flame that the terrorists sought to extinguish. 

 But it is that same torch, so proudly held by the United States, 

that can lead the free world to crush the forces of terror and secure 

our tomorrow. 
</p>
 

 It is within our power. Let us now make sure that it is within our 

will.
