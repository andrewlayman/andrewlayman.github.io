<p>The ancient Greek historian Herodotus wrote
in the mid fifth-century BC about the centuries-long
enmity between the Greeks and the Persians, which
climaxed in the Persian Wars.  He had to rely
primarily on oral accounts of events that occurred
centuries earlier, and consequently it was difficult
for him to be accurate about those events.  He
deserves to be called the "father of history" for his
achievement in committing oral history to writing. 
</p><p>
What is his method? When stories conflict, he often
gives us both sides, refusing to select which is
right.  For example at Book 1 section 5 he says :
"These are the stories of the Persians and the
Phoenicians. For my own part, I will not say that this
or that story is true." He goes on to take a stand
about a particular fact, but his focus remains
primarily on what people said and thought about
history.  In many ways he remains a storyteller. 
</p><p>
He also interprets events in terms of his own time.
His discussion of the establishment of the Persian
monarchy (3.80 f.) is recounted in terms of a
fifth-century Athenian political debate. Taken
literally, the story would mean that the Persians
discovered democracy and oligarchy in the 560's BC,
rejected them in favor of monarchy, and selected their
monarch by a contest of neighing horses. 
</p><p>
In contrast, Thucydides had a different project, and a
different method.  He wrote mostly about contemporary
events which he could witness directly: the
Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta.  He
writes of distant events only when they are necessary
background to his own topic. 
</p><p>
But he is also armed intellectually, with a historical
method that is a qualitative improvement upon that of
Herodotus. Why do men need a method in understanding
history?  He tells us at Book 1 section 20: "For men
accept from one another hearsay reports of former
events, neglecting to test them . . ." He follows this
with a specific example of a historical error accepted
by the Athenians of his own day, then explains this
error: "So averse to taking pains are most men in the
search for the truth, and so prone are they to turn to
what lies ready at hand." 
</p><p>
What is his method? Thucydides distinguishes himself
from storytellers: "But as to the facts of the events
of the war, I have thought it right to give them not
as ascertained by any chance informant nor as seemed
to me probable, but only after investigating with the
greatest possible accuracy each detail . . . possibly
the absence of the fabulous from my narrative will
seem less pleasing to the ear. But if those who wish
to have a clear view both of the events that have
happened and those which will likely occur again
adjudge my history profitable, this will be enough for
me. And indeed it has been composed not as an essay
for the present moment, but as a prize possession for
all time." (1.22) 
</p><p>
The essence of the storyteller's project is to create
a narrative that is pleasing to the reader.  The
standard of what is good is what is appropriate for a
given audience.  The essence of the historians method,
in contrast, is to focus on the facts.  The
storyteller subordinates the facts to the pleasingness
of the story.  The historian subordinates his
narrative to the accuracy of the facts.
</p><p>
Thucydides is not, however, satisfied with simply
cataloguing the particular events of the war.  He
wants to know the reasons for the conflict.  What men
said were the causes of the war was a series of minor
events, mere pretenses which he proceeds to relate.
But the truest cause was in the growth of Athenian
power, and the fear it brought to the Spartans. This
is an integration of those events into a broad
abstract reason for the war. 
</p><p>
But his understanding of the causes of war goes even
deeper, to a moral level.  This is epitomized in the
so-called Melian dialogue (5.84f.).  This is a
grand-scale integration of the deepest reasons for
war, which demonstrates why men need a morality based
on reason rather than force if war and slavery are to
be avoided. These are his ultimate reasons why
Athenian power grew as it did, why the allies of the
Spartans were afraid, why their allies demanded that
the Spartans fight, and why the fight had to be to the
death.  It is because the Athenians rejected reason in
dealing with other men.
</p><p>
What Thucydides did was to state explicitly that human
history is causal, and that causes can be proximate
and long-range. Events are likely to repeat if the
same causes occur again. Understanding long-range
causes is a guide to the future as well as the past.  
</p><p>
Thucydides presents more than an application of
causation to history--his work may hold the very
discovery of causation as a principle of human
affairs.  This is an astounding achievement. It makes
history, which to him meant any investigation into the
facts of human affairs, scientific.
